# Attendance-System
This project is a custom-built smart attendance system designed to eliminate proxy attendance using a time-bound, dynamically resetting QR code mechanism. The system was developed by our team as part of SIH (Smart India Hackathon) internal college evaluation, where it secured 2nd Prize for innovation and practical implementation.
