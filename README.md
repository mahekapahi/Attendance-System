# Attendance-System
This project is a custom-built smart attendance system designed to eliminate proxy attendance using a time-bound, dynamically resetting QR code mechanism. The system was developed by our team as part of SIH (Smart India Hackathon) internal college evaluation, where it secured 2nd Prize for innovation and practical implementation.

END GOAL - ENTREPRENUERSHIP (RETIRE BY MID 30S)

Project Overview
The Smart QR-Based Attendance System is an automated student attendance monitoring and analytics platform designed to eliminate proxy attendance and improve transparency in educational institutions. The system leverages time-bound, dynamically rotating QR codes, secure session generation, and real-time dashboards to ensure accurate and reliable attendance for both offline and online classes.
This project was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 and focuses on creating a scalable, secure, and data-driven solution suitable for colleges and rural schools.


Problem Statement
Traditional attendance systems—manual roll calls, static QR codes, or paper-based methods—are inefficient, error-prone, and highly vulnerable to proxy attendance. These systems also fail to provide meaningful insights into student engagement and attendance trends.

Proposed Solution
Our system automates attendance using QR code-based check-ins with multiple layers of validation:
Teachers generate unique attendance sessions
QR codes rotate periodically to prevent reuse
Students scan QR codes to mark attendance
Optional OTP verification adds an extra layer of security
All attendance data is logged with timestamps and device-level tracking, ensuring authenticity and accuracy.

Key Features
Dynamic QR Code Attendance
QR codes refresh automatically, preventing sharing or reuse.
Role-Based Access
Teacher Dashboard: Create sessions, monitor attendance, view analytics, and handle disputes
Student Interface: Scan QR codes, view attendance status, and raise disputes
Dispute Resolution System
Students can report attendance issues, which teachers can review and resolve through the dashboard.
Real-Time Analytics
Dashboards display attendance records, trends, and student engagement insights.
Secure & Future-Ready Architecture
Designed to scale with support for biometric systems and cloud deployment in the future.

Unique Value Proposition
Security: QR rotation, OTP verification, and device tracking prevent misuse
Data-Driven: Attendance analytics enable better academic monitoring
Scalable: Suitable for institutions of varying sizes
User-Friendly: Simple and intuitive UI for teachers and students

Technology Stack
